# Project JueK3y | A personal website
<br>

## What is the JueK3y website?
The website is a portfolio about me (JueK3y). 
<br>There are the three main topics coding, photography and design. In addition,
<br>the website contains the following items:
- [Landing Page (Index)](https://www.juek3y.com/de/)
- [Biographie](https://www.juek3y.com/de/bio)
- Experience (Coding | Photography | Design)
- [Contact](https://www.juek3y.com/de/contact) (Business | Personal)
- [Settings](https://www.juek3y.com/de/settings) (FAQ | Issue Tracker | Legal)
- It also includes:
  - Automatic detection for Light / Dark mode
  - Switch between those two modes
  - Automatic detection of EN or DE language
  - Change between EN and DE
  - Download
<br>

## When will the website be ready?
Currently, the website is still a work in progress.
<br>Since the scope of the site is quite complex, it may take some time until completion.
<br>As soon as an exact date is known, this paragraph will be updated _(*)_.

## What is the URL of the website?
The official domain for the website is [juek3y.com](https://juek3y.com).
<br>However, the website can also be accessed as a Netlify subdomain via [juek3y.netlify.app](https://juek3y.netlify.app).
<br>However, this is not an official way and will be used as an automatic redirect to the main domain in the near future.

<br>

## The website only works incorrectly for me / I have found errors
This may well occur in an unfinished website.
<br>I would appreciate it if you would then open a [new issue](https://github.com/JueK3y/juek3y.com/issues/new) so I can take care of the bug.
<br>Thanks for your help!
